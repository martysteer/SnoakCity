Well, itâ€™s not too far from Meheric or Platport, or even Trevury, and can probably be reached from your nearest Podport, if you can afford the fare. They speak English there, even though some of their names hint at a history of assimilation. As for the inhabitants, their lives are spent much as ours, learning how to cope with entropy and other people while trying to have fun some of the time.
